Scope
    Create an irreversable hashfunction

Ideas
    use existing hash algoritms
    Break the input into smaller sections, each of which is run through a different hash
    Combine the hashes of each section & hash the result

    use bitwise operators to scramble the input
    break input int smaller pieces
    use bitwise operators to scramble each section differently
    combine the sections & then hash the result
